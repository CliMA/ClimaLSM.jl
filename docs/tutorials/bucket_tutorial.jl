# # Introduction to the Land Bucket Model

# The land bucket model implemented in ClimaLSM is based off of
# the models of Manabe (1969)[1], Milly and Shmakin (2002)[2], and the SLIM
# model (Laguë, Bonan, Swann 2019)[3], with small changes, as noted.

# This tutorial explains in brief the core equations and the
# necessary parameters of the bucket model, and shows how to set up a simulation in standalone
# mode. More detail for coupled runs can be
# found in the ClimaCoupler.jl [documentation.](https://clima.github.io/ClimaCoupler.jl/dev/) and in the coupled simulation [tutorial](https://clima.github.io/ClimaLSM.jl/dev/generated/coupled_bucket/).

# At each coordinate point on the surface, we solve ordinary differential
# equations for the subsurface water content
# of land (`W`, m), the surface temperature of the land (`T_sfc`, K),
# and the surface water content of land (`Ws`, m). This tutorial will
# be modified in the future to 
# explain simulations involving snow water equivalent, though we have set
# some of the groundwork for that in the code already (e.g. with albedo).

# We have:

# ``
# \frac{d W}{dt} = I(W, P_{liq}, E),
# ``

# ``
# \frac{d Ws}{dt} = P_{liq} - E - I(W, P_{liq}, E),
# ``

# ``
# \frac{ρc dT_{sfc}}{dt} = - \frac{1}{d} (F_{sfc} - F_{bot}),
# ``

# ``
# F_{sfc} = R_n+ SHF + LHF
# ``

# ``
# R_n = -(1-α)*SW↓ -LW↓ + σT_{sfc}^4
# ``

# ``
# F_{bot} = -κ \frac{T_{sfc} - T_{base}}{d}
# ``

# where `I` is the infiltration as defined in [1], `P_liq` (m/s) is the
# water volume flux of precipitation, `E` (m/s) is the water volume flux
# in evaporation, `ρc` is the volumetric
# heat capacity of the land,  `R_n` is the net radiation, `SHF` the sensible
# heat flux, `LHF` the latent heat flux, `α(lat, lon)` is the
# surface albedo, `σ` the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,  `κ` is the thermal
# conductivity, `T_base` the base temperature at depth `d`, and
# `d` is the soil
# depth. The albedo is a linear interpolation between the albedo of soil and
# snow, as decribed in [3].

# Turbulent surface fluxes of sensible heat, latent heat, and water vapor
# (`SHF, LHF, E`) are computed using Monin-Obukhov theory; `SW↓` and `LW↓`
# are the downward fluxes in short and long wavelength bands.


# Note that with the exception of precipitation and downwelling radiation,
# all fluxes are defined
# such that positive is towards the atmosphere. The bottom flux can be
# set to zero by setting `κ = 0`.

# When computing the
# evaporation, we use

# ``
# q_{sfc} = β(W, Wf) q_{sat}(T_{sfc}, ρ_{sfc}),
# ``

# where β is the factor used in [1] which accounts for the land water content when it is below the saturated value. This makes use of the field
# capacity parameter `W_f`. This is different from other bucket models in that
# we modify `q_sfc` directly
# to account for the bucket being below saturation, rather than modify the
# potential evaporation rate itself via a resistance term.


# # Simulating a standalone bucket model

# First, we need to import necessary packages. We use [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl)
# for the timestepping, and [DiffEqCallbacks.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqCallbacks.jl)
# is used as described below,
# for accessing the solver state during the integration.
using OrdinaryDiffEq: ODEProblem, solve, Euler
using DiffEqCallbacks
# We use [ClimaCore](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaCore.jl)
# for setting up the domain/coordinate points. While
# this infrastructure isn't really necessary for standalone simulations,
# adhering to it makes setting up coupled simulations very easy. It also
# is nice to rely on ClimaCore utilities because they have been designed
# in advance for running distributed simulations.
using ClimaCore

# We also use CLIMAParameters, which strives to ensure a common set of
# parameters across all Clima models, and to make parameter estimation
# more seamless.
import CLIMAParameters as CP

# Lastly, let's bring in the bucket model types (from ClimaLSM) that we
# will need access to.

using ClimaLSM.Bucket:
    BucketModel,
    BucketModelParameters,
    PrescribedAtmosphere,
    PrescribedRadiativeFluxes,
    BulkAlbedo
using ClimaLSM.Domains: coordinates, Point
using ClimaLSM: initialize, make_update_aux, make_ode_function
# We also want to plot the solution
using Plots

FT = Float64;

# As mentioned we use CLIMAParameters for earth parameters that are
# required across models (e.g. the density of water and ice, the latent
# heat of fusion at a reference temperature, etc). The land model requires
# additional parameters as described in the text above. These two sets
# are combined in the object `BucketModelParameters` as follows:
import ClimaLSM
include(joinpath(pkgdir(ClimaLSM), "parameters", "create_parameters.jl"));
earth_param_set = create_lsm_parameters(FT);

# Define our `BulkAlbedo` model using a constant soil and snow albedo:
# The soil albedo is a function of coordinates, which would be
# (x,y) on a plane, and (lat,lon) on a sphere. In the future, we
# will support other albedo models.
α_soil = (coordinate_point) -> FT(0.2);

# The soil depth and base temperature
d_soil = FT(10.0);
T_base = FT(280.0);
# Roughness lengths (meters)
z_0m = FT(1e-2);
z_0b = FT(1e-3);
# Thermal parameters of soil
κ_soil = FT(0.0);
ρc_soil = FT(2e6);
Δt = FT(1000.0);

bucket_parameters = BucketModelParameters(
    d_soil,
    T_base,
    κ_soil,
    ρc_soil,
    albedo,
    S_c,
    W_f,
    z_0m,
    z_0b,
    Δt,
    earth_param_set,
);

# Set up the model domain. At every coordinate point, we'll solve
# an ODE for `W`, `Ws`, and `T_sfc`. In coupled simulations run at the same
# resolution as the atmosphere, the bucket domain would match the
# bottom domain of the atmosphere model. In general, however, the two
# resolutions do not need to match. Here we just set up something
# simple - a point, appropriate for single column models.
bucket_domain = Point(; z_sfc = FT(0.0));


# To drive the system in standalone mode,
# the user must provide
# prescribed functions of time for the water volume flux in precipitation
#  for the net downward shortwave and longwave
# radiative energy fluxes (`SW↓, LW↓`, W/m^2),
# for the atmospheric temperature `T_a`,
# wind speed `u_a` (m/s), specific humidity `q_a`, and air density
# `ρ_a` (kg/m^3) at a reference height `h_a` (m),
# as well as for the air density `ρ_sfc` (kg/m^3)
# at the surface of the earth.

# Here we define the model drivers, starting with downward radiation.

# Then, we create the model object, which contains the drivers, parameters,
# domain, and is associated with the correct differential equations
# for the bucket model:
model = BucketModel(
    parameters = bucket_parameters,
    domain = bucket_domain,
    atmosphere = bucket_atmos,
    radiation = bucket_rad,
);

# Note the holder structs for the radiation and atmosphere functions: they
# are named `Prescribed`. In coupled simulations, we would use a different
# type and rely on multiple dispatch to obtain the atmospheric and radiative
# quantitites from the coupler.

# Like all ClimaLSM models, we set up the state vector using `initialize`:
Y, p, coords = initialize(model);

# We can inspect the prognostic and auxiliary variables of the model:
ClimaLSM.prognostic_vars(model)
Y.bucket |> propertynames
# The auxiliary variables in this case are the turbulent fluxes, the
# net radiation, and the surface specific humidity.
ClimaLSM.auxiliary_vars(model)
p.bucket |> propertynames


# Next is to set initial conditions.

Y.bucket.W .= FT(0.1);
Y.bucket.Ws .= FT(0.0);
Y.bucket.S .= FT(0.0);

# Then to create the entire right hand side function for the system
# of ordinary differential equations:
ode_function! = make_ode_function(model);

# Then set up the simulation
t0 = FT(0.0);
tf = FT(3 * 86400);

# We need a callback to get and store the auxiliary fields, as they

# Extracting the solution from what is returned by the ODE.jl commands
# is a bit clunky right now, but we are working on hiding some of this.
